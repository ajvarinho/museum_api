A small image editor written in React/Next.js.
To have images to edit, it fetches Metropolitan Museum's API, and renders results as an image gallery, with information about artworks. 
Users can store images and info of artworks in localStorage, and can do basic editing, like drawing on image and cropping parts of it.
It is deployed on https://museum-api-nu.vercel.app/.
