A small image editor still being written in React/Next.js.
To have images to edit, it fetches Metropolitan Museum's API, and renders results as an image gallery, with information about artworks. 
Users can store images and info of artworks in localStorage, and can do basic editing, like drawing on image and cropping parts of it. I plan to add another feature, effects on images, and the ultimate goal is to allow users to create their images/collages.
It is deployed on https://museum-api-nu.vercel.app/.
